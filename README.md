* Be able to collaborate with other coders
* **Be a good and transparent scientist**

### GitHub, to share your Git repository with your favorite labmates

https://github.com/HartmannLab

We have a [GitHub organization](https://github.com/HartmannLab) for our group. This is a place to collect all our repositories and scripts. You can `git push` your repository there. Then, you and others in the group can access it anywhere, anytime. They may modify it without interfering with your local copy until you `git pull` the modified version from GitHub, and merge it with your own.  
Note that repositories in the `HartmannLab` can be private (only accessible by other members) or public (accessible by anyone on the internet). You can start developping your scripts in a private repository and make it public once you're satisfied with it (which should be when a manuscript is submitted at the latest).
